 <p>Established in 2014, the Arizona Keeper League has been the battleground for fantasy football supremacy for over a decade. This highly competitive league features 16 dedicated team owners, each vying for glory and bragging rights.</p>

<p>League Overview<br>
- Founded: 2014<br>
- Teams: 16<br>
- Format: Keeper League</p>

<p>The Arizona Keeper League isn't just a fantasy football competition; it's a tradition that has stood the test of time. For ten seasons and counting, our league has brought together friends, rivals, and football enthusiasts from across the Grand Canyon State.</p>

<p>Our 16-team format ensures that every roster decision counts and every waiver wire pickup could be the difference between championship glory and bitter defeat. With the keeper aspect adding an extra layer of strategy, owners must balance short-term success with long-term planning.</p>

<p>Our league has crowned several champions since its inception. Here's a list of our past winners:</p>

<p>- 2014: Adam Polson - The C.J. Andersons<br>
- 2015: Matt McDermand - Matt McD's Championship Nips<br>
- 2016: Martin Cisneros - Eazy Es*<br>
- 2017: Mark Huerta - For Whom the Bell Tolls<br>
- 2018: Martin Cisneros - Eazy Es*<br>
- 2019: Alan Ayon - One Nation Under GODwin<br>
- 2020: Martin Cisneros - Eazy Es<br>
- 2021: Joe Krawzyk - Kings Kupp<br>
- 2022: Matt Blumenreich - Bucking Broncos<br>
- 2023: Adam Polson - The Stack <br>
- 2024: Matt Blumenreich - Bucking Broncos
</p>
ÃŸ
<p>Our champions showcase the league's creativity and competitiveness. Noteworthy are Martin Cisneros's early dynasty (2016-2020) and the recent emergence of new champions. Remarkably, Adam Polson claimed both the inaugural 2014 and latest 2023 titles with different teams.</p>
